# Mahek-s-Amazon-Clone
A clone of the website amazon.com which no differs than the actual website.

Welcome to my Amazon website clone project, built using HTML and CSS!

## Overview

This project replicates the structure and visual design of Amazon's homepage, offering a foundation for exploring front-end development concepts. It's a static clone, meaning it doesn't implement actual eCommerce functionality.

## Technologies Used

HTML5: Constructs the core structure and content of the webpage.

CSS3: Styles the elements to match Amazon's design, ensuring a visually appealing and consistent look.

## Features

Key Page Elements: Includes the header, navigation bar, search bar, hero banner, product listings, and footer.

Visual Fidelity: Adheres to Amazon's color scheme, typography, and layout to create a recognizable experience.

Responsive Design: Adapts to different screen sizes and devices for optimal viewing.
